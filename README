This directory contains older projects written for Windows, using
the Platform SDK. Projects range in age from 3 to 9 years old.
All projects are written in C++, and contain the original Visual Studio
project files.

This directory also contains example code I have written to help me
cement the concepts in my mind and help me remember.
